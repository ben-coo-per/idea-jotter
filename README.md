# idea-jotter
Basic app to quickly write down ideas built w/ swiftUI &amp; swift-composable-architecture

When I have an idea when I'm away from my journal, I usually text just it to myself. 
This works fine since all I'm after is a low effort way to mark down a thought that can be thrown away later.

There are, however, 2 frustrations I have with this approach:
1. The texts are all duplicated since I'm sending it to myself. This makes looking through the ideas cumbersome, especially when there is a thread of multiple texts explaining the same idea
2. I don't have a good way to mark/tag ideas & no way to easily explore things I've writted down in the past.

There are tons of apps for notes/journals/etc. I couldn't find one I liked for this use-case.
### I need something that:
 - has little to no friction getting to the actual "jotting" of the idea
 - doesn't expect notes to be self-explaining or well crafted. I usually jot these down on morning walks I usually say something completely illegible if you haven't been on the journey to get to the idea (e.g. "Animated avatar real-time responses"). I don't want an app that treats my notes as 'sacred' or 'high-fidelity'
 - has a way to remove cluttering notes into their own groups
 - is a good excuse to practice Swift
